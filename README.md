# Brest-Cancer-Prediction

The model was created using a knn machine learning algorithm using the Brest cancer dataset. The dataset used in the project is https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data. After the tune process, the results were compared. After that, a comparison was made using two different methods, Principal component analysis (PCA) and Neighborhood components analysis (NCA), to reduce the parameters. Thus, a comparison was made in 4 different ways in the project.

The following libraries were used in the project.

- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- warnings
